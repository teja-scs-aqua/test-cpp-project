= LuxRender =

The experimental new <<LuxRenderPlugins>>
allow K-3D scenes to be rendered using http://www.luxrender.net LuxRender - ``a
new, open-source, free software rendering system for physically correct,
unbiased image synthesis.''

== Usage ==

As with all render engines, the key to using LuxRender in a K-3D scene is to:

* Assign LuxRender materials to your geometry.
* Use LuxRender lights to light the scene.
* Use <<LuxRenderEngine>> to render the scene.

For example:

* Start a new K-3D scene.
* Add a <<LuxRenderSunLight>> and <<LuxRenderSkyLight>> to provide physically-based lighting.
* Create some new geometry for the scene, such as a small <<PolyCube>> sitting on top of a large, flat <<PolyCube>>.
* Create a new <<LuxRenderEngine>>.
* Choose Render > Frame from the menus, and pick the <<LuxRenderEngine>> when prompted.  Supply an output image, and wait for the render to complete.

== Caveats ==

<<LuxRenderEngine>> renders images by executing the "luxconsole" command (note:
lower-case).  This should work out-of-the-box on GNU/Linux and Windows.  On
MacOSX, the luxconsole executable is distributed in an application bundle which
the user could put anywhere.  In this case, you will either have to adjust your
PATH to point to the interior of the bundle, or create a shell script wrapper
to start the render engine, something along the lines of:

--------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
cd /Applications/LuxRender.app/Contents/MacOS
./luxrender $*
--------------------------------------------------------

... and ensure that the wrapper script can be found on your PATH.
