NAME
----
k3d - 3D modeling and animation system.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*k3d* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
K-3D is the free (as in freedom) 3D modeling, animation, and rendering system
for systems including GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, Windows, and others. K-3D features a
robust, object-oriented plugin architecture and is capable of producing
motion-picture-quality output when paired with a RenderMan Interface compliant
render engine such as Aqsis.

OPTIONS
-------

*--add-path*='PATH'::
Prepends a filesystem path to the PATH environment variable.

*--batch*::
Enables batch (no user intervention) mode.

*--color*::
Color-codes log messages based on their priority.  Requires an ANSI
color-capable terminal.

*--disable-gl-extension*='EXTENSION'::
Disables the given OpenGL extension (whether it is supported by the
underlyinghardware or not).

*--enable-gl-extension*='EXTENSION'::
Enables the given OpenGL extension (whether it is supported by the underlying
hardware or not).

*--exit*::
Exits the program after startup (useful when running scripts in batch mode).

*-h, --help*::
Prints this help information and exits.

*--list-gl-extensions*::
List available OpenGL extensions and exit.

*--locale*='PATH'::
Overrides the path for loading locales.

*--log-level*='LEVEL'::
Specifies the minimal message priority to display: 'warning', 'information'
or 'debug'.  Defaults to 'warning'.

*--options*='PATH'::
Overrides the filepath for storing user options (this overrides the default
and the K3D_OPTIONS_PATH environment variable).

*--plugins*='PATHS'::
Overrides the path(s) for loading plugin libraries (this overrides the
default and the K3D_PLUGIN_PATHS environment variable).  Multiple
colon-delimited paths are allowed.  Use "&" as a synonym for the default
paths.

*--no-color*::
Disable color-coding of log messages based on their priority.

*-e, --script*='SCRIPT'::
Executes the given script text after startup.

*-f, --script-file*='PATH'::
Executes the given script file after startup (use - for stdin).

*--setenv*='ARG'::
Set an environment variable using name=value syntax.

*--shadercache*='PATH'::
Overrides the path where compiled shaders will be cached (this overrides the
default and the K3D_SHADER_CACHE_PATH environment variable).

*--share*='PATH'::
Overrides the path for loading shared data files (this overrides the default
and the K3D_SHARE_PATH environment variable).

*--show-process*::
Prints the process name next to log messages.

*--show-timestamps*::
Prints timestamps next to log messages.

*--syslog*::
Logs messages to syslog.

*-u, --ui*='ARG'::
Specifies the user interface to use at startup: 'nui', 'ngui', 'qtui',
'pyui', or the path to a user interface plugin (this overrides the default
and the K3D_USER_INTERFACE_PATH environment variable).

*-H, --user-interface-help*::
Prints additional command line options based on the the current choice of
user interface, and exits.

*--version*::
Prints program version information and exits.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

*K3D_EXTRA_OPTIONS*::
Provides additional options that are appended to the command-line at startup.
Note that unlike other K-3D environment variables, options specified via
K3D_EXTRA_OPTIONS will override options specified on the command line.
Typically used to pass command-line arguments when running the program from
the build tree. 

*K3D_OPTIONS_PATH*::
Overrides the path for storing user options (this overrides the default, but
can be overridden by the --options option).

*K3D_PLUGIN_PATHS*::
Overrides the path(s) for loading plugin libraries (this overrides the
default, but can be overridden by the --plugins option).  Multiple
colon-delimited paths are allowed.  Use "&" as a synonym for the default
paths.

*K3D_SHADER_CACHE_PATH*::
Overrides the path where compiled shaders are cached (this overrides the
default, but can be overridden by the --shadercache option).

*K3D_SHARE_PATH*::
Overrides the path for loading shared data files (this overrides the default,
but can be overridden by the --share option).

*K3D_USER_INTERFACE_PATH*::
Overrides the path to the user interface plugin (this overrides the default,
but can be overridden by the --ui option).


EXIT STATUS
-----------

*0*::
    Success

*Non-zero*::
    Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; runtime
    failure; unexpected error).
