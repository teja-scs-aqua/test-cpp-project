K3D-RENDERFRAME(1)
==================

NAME
----
k3d-renderframe - Part of a simple system for queueing K-3D render jobs on the local host

SYNOPSIS
--------
*k3d-renderframe* ['OPTIONS'] ['DIRECTORY' ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Extracted from http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/Network_Rendering

Currently, K-3D implements a simple system for queueing rendering jobs on the
local host. When the user initiates a job (such as rendering a preview image,
rendering a final frame, or rendering an animation), a job directory is created
(usually in /tmp, although this can be configured). The job directory contains
a lock file, a control file named control.k3d, and one-to-many numbered frame
directories. The name of the lock file changes to flag the sta.IP tus of the
job as "ready", "running", "complete", or "error". The control.k3d file is
currently unused.  Each frame directory contains a lock file, a control file
named control.k3d and zero-to-many frame resources. The name of the lock file
changes to flag the status of the frame as "ready", "running", "complete", or
"error". The control.k3d file is an XML file that encodes a set of operations
that must be completed successfully to change the status of the frame from
"ready" to "complete". Three types of operation are allowed: a "render"
operation that executes a pre-configured render command using a fixed set of
command-line arguments, a "copy" operation that copies a file from one
filesystem location to another; and a "view" operation that displays a bitmap
image using the user's choice of image viewer. The frame resources are inputs
to the render engine, such as RIB files, texture images, shaders, etc. 

The k3d-renderjob executable is run with the path to a job directory as an
argument. k3d-renderjob updates the job lock file, iterating over each frame
directory, spawning an instance of k3d-renderframe for each frame (one at a
time). k3d-renderframe is run with the path to a frame directory as an
argument, updating the frame lock file, reading the control file, and executing
the operations that it specifies.
