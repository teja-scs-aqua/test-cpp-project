title: Review plugin names

  Among other proposals:
  
  Should JoinPoints be changed to FusePoints, or UnitePoints, because
  join points means form a line between two points (or more if there is
  sequence data in the selection set)?
  
  "Join" has also been misused elsewhere so if we change join to a more
  appropriate word it should be done consistently.
