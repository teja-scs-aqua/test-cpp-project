  Description of problem:
  When starting K-3D, only a black screen is visible in the main window under
  Viewport. I'm new to this
  application, and I do see an X and Y Grid pop up for a second when I
  attempt to create a new object such as a cube or cone, and then
  the screen goes black again.
  Steps to reproduce problem:
  
  1. Install Ubuntu 8.04
  2. Enable desktop effects
  3. Install K-3D using Synaptic package manager
  4. Start the application, and only a black screen under Viewport should be
  visible
  5. Try creating a cube, and the black screen should display the workspace
  grid for about a
  half second.

  Actual results:
  
  How often does this happen?

  - This is a known issue with Compiz and DRI, it is addressed by DRI2.  To mitigate the problem, I've added a CheckCompiz plugin that warns end-users if Compiz is running when they start K-3D.
