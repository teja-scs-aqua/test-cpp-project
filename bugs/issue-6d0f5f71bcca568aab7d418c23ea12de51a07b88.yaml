title: 5  Bug while moving vertices, edges and faces on a tutorial
desc: "Resuming:\n\
  1-Start recording a tutorial\n\
  2-Select a face/edge/vertex\n\
  3-Move it\n\
  4-Without changing the move tool select and move another face/edge/vertex\n\
  5-Play the script\n\n\
  I attach a k3dscript file for reproducing the bug.\n\
  It throws on the terminal (in 0.6.7 and 0.7.0)\n\
  WARNING: Selection contained records without nodes\n\
  ERROR Command node [move_tool] unhandled command: [lmb_click_replace]\n\
  [<arguments><viewport>/document/window/viewport</viewport><mouse>0.418126\n\
  0.638689</mouse></arguments>]\n\n\
  This script was recorded on k3d 0.6.7 and when played on 0.7 it selects a\n\
  different face. Seems like coordinates are upside down. I'll will submit\n\
  another bug report on this subject.\n\n\
  Thanks for merging the mug script!\n\n\
  Cheers,\n\
