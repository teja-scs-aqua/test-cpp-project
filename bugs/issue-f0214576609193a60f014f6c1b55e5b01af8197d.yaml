title: Problems with Axes text labels
desc: |-
  But I still have a problem with the text labels of the Axes node, they
  all seem to read Z but it is in wire-frame and light gray, basically
  unreadable, and changing the font does not help, but you can see the
  size change.
  
  This is using "make run" from the build directory. I also tried
  copying the fonts to the /k3d-build/share/fonts dir and also
  installing them on my system with sudo cp *.ttf
  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/; sudo fc-cache -f -v
  
  Text annotations 2D and 3D work without a problem.
