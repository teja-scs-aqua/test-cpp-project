title: Display component selections when adding a selection modifier.
desc: When adding a geometry selection modifier to the pipeline, component selection visibility isn't enabled, making it impossible to see the effects of the modifier and causing user confusion.  We need a mechanism so the UI layer can turn-on component selection visibility in the MeshInstance when a selection modifier is created.
