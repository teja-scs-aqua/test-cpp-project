title: 5 Mouse jumps to right screen border with manipulators
desc: |-
  My mouse cursor jumps to the right border of my primary screen (note: I
  have a dual screen setup, my primary is on the right). This happens
  whenever you have nothing selected and select something while you either
  use the move, rotate or scale tool (those with manipulators). I used an svn
  build of today (30.03.08) which is build via mingw on windows xp.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  
  1. Open K3D
  2. Create a poly cube
  3. Press space to deselect it
  4. go into either move, rotate or scale mode (w,e,r)
  5. Click on the cube and the mouse jumps to the right border of your screen
