title: NGUI startup fails on FreeBSD.
desc: |-
  During startup on FreeBSD 8, initialization of the user interface plugin fails, generating the following error message:
  
  CRITICAL: Caught exception [std::runtime_error] - UI plugin module [/home/jared/k3d-build/lib/k3d/plugins/k3d-ngui.module] does not implement k3d::iuser_interface
  *** Error code 1
  
  ... this error means that a dynamic_cast to k3d::iuser_interface is failing, which should never happen since we know that the NGUI does, in fact, implement k3d::iuser_interface.

  - It looks like this problem is solved using the description at http://gcc.gnu.org/faq.html#dso ... in light of what the FAQ says, it's surprising that this has ever worked with any gcc build !?

  - Making executable symbols explicitly available to the dynamic linker fixes this issue.
