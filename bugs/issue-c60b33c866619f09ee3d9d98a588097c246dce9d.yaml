title: Eliminate libuuid dependency.
desc: It would be nice if we could switch to using the uuid support in Boost to eliminate our dependency on libuuid (requires Boost 1.42).  This assumes that Boost 1.42-or-better is widely available (i.e. on Ubuntu).

  - Updated our Boost dependency to 1.42, which provides UUID functionality, and provided our own fallback implementation of the Boost 1.43 boost::uuids::random_generator.
