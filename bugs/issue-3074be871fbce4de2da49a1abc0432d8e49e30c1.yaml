  With materials the the missing part is texture input not a color,
  treat color as a 1x1 map of a given color, all the attributes of
  textures need map input to allow for realism and also to simulate
  things such as mesh http://images.google.com.au/images?q=architectural
  mesh and fritted glass
  http://images.google.com.au/images?q=fritted+glass  which is a common
  method of sun control in architecture.
