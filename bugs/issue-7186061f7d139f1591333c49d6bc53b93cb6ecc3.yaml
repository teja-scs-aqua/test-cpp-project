title: RenderManArrayXD plugins should be more generic.
desc: |-
  I think that RenderManArray...
  (http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/Array_Plugins) should be converted into a
  more generic RenderingProxyArray and that it should also be able to
  generate an array of actual object instances so that it can be used as
  a modeling tool and for cases where a proxy cannot be used in the
  chosen output format.
  
  At the moment it will not work with LuxRender but Lux does support
  geometry instancing.
