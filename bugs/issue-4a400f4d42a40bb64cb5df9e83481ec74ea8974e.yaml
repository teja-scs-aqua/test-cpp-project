title: "assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed "
desc: |-
  I typed in "shadowdistant" in the shader path string space, and then
  pressed the "Relative"
  pulldown menu, and then pressed it really fast, again. The error I get is:
  
  ERROR Gtk: gtk_widget_event: assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget,
  event)' failed
  
  K3D is still going, and when I highlight something with my cursor(like
  "Shader Path"), it
  shows a tooltip. I am not able to exit using the "X" in the upperright
  corner of K3D. I had to "Ctrl+C" K3D in the console I ran it from.
  
  Unfortunatly, I am not able to reproduce this bug on purpose, only on
  accident. But I know
  for a positive, 100% fact that it has to do with the "Relative, Absolute,
  Inline" pulldown menu.
  
  I hope this was descriptive enough. I've had a lot of problems with this in
  the past 2 days of working with K3D, and think it's a pretty big bug.
  
  System specs:
  PCLinuxOS 2007
  GTK 2.12.2-4pclos2007
  K3D 0.6.7.0
  
  K3D is nice, btw. I hope it "grows up" more.
