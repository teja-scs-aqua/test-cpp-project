title: Errors creating VirtualOpenGLSDSPainter at startup with advanced painters disabled
desc: |-
  We get harmless-but-annoying errors loading the VirtualOpenGLSDSFacePainter plugin at startup:
  
  ERROR: /home/jared/k3d/modules/virtual_opengl_painters/sds_point_painter.cpp line 73: assertion
  
  delegate' failed
  ERROR: Error creating document plugin: VirtualOpenGLSDSPointPainter
  ERROR: /home/jared/k3d/modules/virtual_opengl_painters/sds_edge_painter.cpp line 73: assertion `delegate' failed
  ERROR: Error creating document plugin: VirtualOpenGLSDSEdgePainter
  ERROR: /home/jared/k3d/modules/virtual_opengl_painters/sds_face_painter.cpp line 73: assertion `delegate' failed
  ERROR: Error creating document plugin: VirtualOpenGLSDSFacePainter
  
  ... this is because the UI layer unconditionally loads the virtual SDS painters at startup, but all the
  SDS painters are in the advanced painter module, which is off by default.
  
  We need to: move the SDS painters out of the advanced module; turn the advanced module on by default; don't create
  SDS painters by default; best - figure-out a way to avoid creating any painters until they're needed.

  - In the short-term, we've disabled all of the experimental painters and enabled the SDS painters, so the advanced painter module can be enabled by default.
