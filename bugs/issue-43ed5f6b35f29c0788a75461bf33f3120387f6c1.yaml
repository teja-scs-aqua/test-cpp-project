title: Texture baking from RM SL to bitmaps.
desc: |-
  CGKit lets you bake a Renderman texture
  http://cgkit.sourceforge.net/tutorials/baking/baking.html  this method
  would allow renderman shaders as input to Luxrender textures, or any
  of the bitmap nodes for that matter. Perhaps not now, but in the
  future having GEGL in the pipeline would be very powerful (replace
  imagemagik?) http://gegl.org/  their way of doing things is very
  similar to your design of K-3D's architecture.
