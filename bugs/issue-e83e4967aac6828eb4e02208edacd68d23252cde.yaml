title: 5 Animation rendering code can't handle negative time values
desc: |-
  The main animation loops in the RenderMan and Yafray engines convert the
  start and end times to unsigned integers, then loop over them to create
  frames. This won't work for ranges of negative time - we need to be
  smarter about how we map the range of times to be rendered to frame
  names.
