title: Path User Properties are not well serialized
desc: |-
  Inspecting the file, they are serialized
  <property name="test" reference="relative" relative_path=""/>
  This xml above won't load any property
  
  If I edit it it will load well
  <property name="test" reference="relative" relative_path=""
  type="k3d::filesystem::path" user_property="generic"/>
  
  Cheers!
