title: Selected polygon face colors rendered incorrectly.
desc: |-
  Is anyone else having trouble seeing the selected face color (red)
  when selecting polygon faces? Debug output shows the color gets set,
  but somehow it doesn't show in the viewport (only orientation and
  normal show up). The code (regular_opengl_painters/face_painter.cpp)
  seems fine to me, so I suspect this is another bug in the Intel X
  driver for laptop chipsets. I am using a GM965/GL960 and Ubuntu
  Jaunty.
