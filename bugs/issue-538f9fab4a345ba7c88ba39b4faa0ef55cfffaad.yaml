title: Manipulators dissapear when changing the selection mode.
desc: "Steps:\n\
  1- New document\n\
  2- Create cube\n\
  3- Switch to vertex selection and select something\n\
  4- Change the selection mode. Manipulators are gone.\n\n\
  Seems that manipulators and transformations tools are acting weird. More\n\
  bugs on this later\n\n\
  Cheers!\n\
