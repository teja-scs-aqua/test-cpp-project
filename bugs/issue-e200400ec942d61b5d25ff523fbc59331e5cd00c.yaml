title: bug report for scripting issue
desc: |-
  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1772963&forum_id=34831
  
  keeping in mind that I'm a total newbie to this and I should probably just
  learn how to create before I tackle scripting; that said Ive tried
  opening/playing any and all scripts that I have. Basically ones that came
  with the program upon installation. There's a file extention of py and pyc
  for each file. I tried editing a file and adding #python on the 1st line
  but that didnt work. Ive attached a file for you.
  
  hope this helps a bit. lemme know if you need any more info.
  thanks
