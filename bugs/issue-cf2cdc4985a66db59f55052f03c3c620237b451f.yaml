title: Program hang loading documents in OSX release build.
desc: Like it says ... document.serialization.properties and sdk.xml-xpath display this behavior - the process is 'hung' with zero CPU, and can't be killed.

    This issue manifests during k3d::xml::xpath parsing as a program hang when doing XPath matching with an attribute-value test.
    For example, line 101 of k3d/tests/sdk/xml_xpath.cpp when doing a match on /k3d/nodes/node/properties/property[@user_property][@type='double']
    Upgrading from Apple gcc 4.0.1 to XCode 3.1.4 and 686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5577) fixes the problem.
