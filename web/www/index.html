				<h2>Easy</h2>
				<p>K-3D's interface uses your platform's look-and-feel, and it's consistent with
				the applications you already know.  New artists will find K-3D easy to understand,
				and professionals feel right at home. K-3D is intuitive, consistent, and discoverable.</p>

				<h2>Powerful</h2>
				<p>K-3D features procedural and parametric workflows. Properties can be adjusted
				interactively and results appear immediately.  The powerful, node-based visualization
				pipeline allows more possibilities than traditional modifier stacks or histories.
				Selection flows from one modifier to the next.</p>

				<p>An advanced undo/redo system ensures you can always go back, and the pioneering undo
				tree means you can always go forward, even where other programs lose the ability to redo.</p>

				<p>Industrial-strength standards form the foundation on which K-3D builds - including
				native RenderMan(TM) support that integrates tightly with the K-3D user interface.</p>

				<h2>Flexible</h2>
				<p>Get all the power of a node-based visualization pipeline: connect anything to anything else.
				K-3D gives you the freedom to create combinations never before seen.</p>

				<p>Work on one side of a model, show the other side mirrored, and see the end result welded
				together as a subdivision surface in realtime.  Using K-3D, complex workflows are easy to create
				and understand.  Go back, modify the beginning of a workflow, and watch as changes propagate
				automatically to the end.</p>

				<h2>Free</h2>
				<p>K-3D is Free Software. Run it on your choice of platform.  Adapt it for any purpose.
				Receive it at no cost.  Share it with your friends.  All of the K-3D source code is
				available under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">GNU General Public License</a>.</p>
