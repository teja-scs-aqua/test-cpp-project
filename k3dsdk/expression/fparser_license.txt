Copyright Â© 2003-2005 Juha Nieminen, Joel Yliluoma

  This library is distributed under two distinct usage licenses depending
on the software ("Software" below) which uses the Function Parser library
("Library" below).
  The reason for having two distinct usage licenses is to make the library
compatible with the GPL license while still being usable in other non-GPL
(even commercial) software.

A) If the Software using the Library is distributed under the GPL license,
   then the Library can be used under the GPL license as well.

   The Library will be under the GPL license only when used with the
   Software. If the Library is separated from the Software and used in
   another different software under a different license, then the Library
   will have the B) license below.

   Exception to the above: If the Library is modified for the GPL Software,
   then the Library cannot be used with the B) license without the express
   permission of the author of the modifications. A modified library will
   be under the GPL license by default. That is, only the original,
   unmodified version of the Library can be taken to another software
   with the B) license below.

   The author of the Software should provide an URL to the original
   version of the Library if the one used in the Software has been
   modified. (http://iki.fi/warp/FunctionParser/)

   This text file must be distributed in its original intact form along
   with the sources of the Library. (Documentation about possible
   modifications to the library should be put in a different text file.)

B) If the Software using the Library is not distributed under the GPL
   license but under any other license, then the following usage license
   applies to the Library:

  1. This library is free for non-commercial usage. You can do whatever you
     like with it as long as you don't claim you made it yourself.

  2. It is possible to use this library in a commercial program, but in this
     case you MUST contact me first (warp@iki.fi) and ask express permission
     for this. (Read explanation at the end of the file.)
       If you are making a free program or a shareware program with just a
     nominal price (5 US dollars or less), you don't have to ask for
     permission.
       In any case, I DON'T WANT MONEY for the usage of this library. It is
     free, period.

  3. You can make any modifications you want to it so that it conforms your
     needs. If you make modifications to it, you have, of course, credits for
     the modified parts.

  4. If you use this library in your own program, you don't have to provide
     the source code if you don't want to (ie. the source code of your program
     or this library).
       If you DO include the source code for this library, this text file
     must be included in its original intact form.

  5. If you distribute a program which uses this library, and specially if you
     provide the source code, proper credits MUST be included. Trying to
     obfuscate the fact that this library is not made by you or that it is
     free is expressly prohibited. When crediting the usage of this library,
     it's enough to include my name and email address, that is:
     "Juha Nieminen (warp@iki.fi)". Also a URL to the library download page
     would be nice, although not required. The official URL is:
       http://iki.fi/warp/FunctionParser/

  6. And the necessary "lawyer stuff":

     The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
     included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

     The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
     express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.
     In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any
     claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
     tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the
     software or the use or other dealings in the software.


---  Explanation of the section 2 of the B) license above:

  The section 2 tries to define "fair use" of the library in commercial
programs.
  "Fair use" of the library means that the program is not heavily dependent
on the library, but the library only provides a minor secondary feature
to the program.
  "Heavily dependent" means that the program depends so much on the library
that without it the functionality of the program would be seriously
degraded or the program would even become completely non-functional.

  In other words: If the program does not depend heavily on the library,
that is, the library only provides a minor secondary feature which could
be removed without the program being degraded in any considerable way,
then it's OK to use the library in the commercial program.
  If, however, the program depends so heavily on the library that
removing it would make the program non-functional or degrade its
functionality considerably, then it's NOT OK to use the library.

  The ideology behind this is that it's not fair to use a free library
as a base for a commercial program, but it's fair if the library is
just a minor, unimportant extra.

  If you are going to ask me for permission to use the library in a
commercial program, please describe the feature which the library will
be providing and how important it is to the program.
